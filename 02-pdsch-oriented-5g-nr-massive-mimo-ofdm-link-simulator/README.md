# 5G NR PDSCH Massive MIMO-OFDM Link-Level Simulator

A verified, three-environment (MATLAB / Python / Simulink) physical-layer link-level simulator for the 3GPP 5G NR PDSCH, built around a 64×8 massive MIMO-OFDM configuration with wideband SVD eigenbeamforming, LS channel estimation, ZF/MMSE equalization, and a TS 38.212 LDPC coded mode.

Every curve and table in this repository was produced by executing the code, passing automated verification gates, and saving the result with full file-level provenance. No illustrative or hand-drawn results are included.

## What is implemented

**Transmitter** — CRC-24A transport block, Gold-sequence scrambling, QPSK/16/64/256-QAM mapping (TS 38.211 bit ordering), layer mapping, DM-RS insertion, wideband SVD eigenbeamforming precoder, CP-OFDM modulation (256-FFT, 30 kHz SCS, 12 RB verification numerology).

**Channel** — AWGN, flat Rayleigh, 3GPP TDL profiles; one independent realization per Monte Carlo frame; total-transmit-SNR noise calibration.

**Receiver** — LS channel estimation on DM-RS, ZF and unbiased MMSE equalization, demapping, descrambling, CRC check; soft-output path with per-RE noise variance for LDPC LLRs.

**Coded mode** — 5G Toolbox `nrDLSCH` encoder/decoder (segmentation, LDPC, rate matching) with `nrSymbolModulate`/`nrSymbolDemodulate`, on the verified chain.

**Metrics** — BER, BLER, EVM, NMSE, throughput, spectral efficiency, layer-domain capacity.

**Simulink testbench** — `NR_PDSCH_LinkLevel_Sim.slx`: one Monte Carlo frame per simulation step; five annotated stages; every MATLAB Function block is a thin `sl_*` wrapper around the verified project functions; live Spectrum Analyzer and Constellation Diagram; To-Workspace logging; automated SNR-grid sweep with pass/fail verdicts against the MATLAB reference CSV.

---

## Monte Carlo method

Each SNR point is estimated from independent random trials (60 frames for the massive campaign; 40/100 transport blocks for the coded grids). Every trial draws fresh random payload bits, a fresh channel realization, and fresh noise; metrics are counted/averaged over the trials. `rng(7)` is set once, so the complete experiment is exactly reproducible. Zero-error entries are reported as below the campaign's rule-of-three resolution (≈1.8×10⁻⁶ on 1.66×10⁶ bits/point), never extrapolated.

## Verification before any result

Four gates run automatically before every campaign and abort on failure:

1. Constellation power exactly 1 for all orders
2. Noiseless modulation round trip error-free
3. OFDM round-trip error at machine precision (1.19×10⁻¹⁵)
4. CRC-24A accepts valid and rejects corrupted blocks

The coded campaigns add gates L1–L3 (noiseless coded round trip + CRC, LLR sign convention, full-chain decode at 30 dB). Unit tests against closed-form theory: `test_awgn.m`, `test_awgn_theory.m` (ideal CSI within 0.007 decades of theory), `test_rayleigh_theory.m`.

*(Adjust paths above to the actual repo layout if it differs.)*

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2023b or later; **5G Toolbox** (coded mode only); **Simulink** + DSP System Toolbox scopes (testbench only). The uncoded MATLAB campaigns run on base MATLAB.
- Python 3.10+ with NumPy and Matplotlib for the reference implementation.

## Quick start

```matlab
cd matlab_pkg
main                    % gates -> 64×8 campaign -> matlab_results_massive.csv + Figures
run_comparisons         % theory checks, ZF/MMSE, capacity, beamforming gain
run_ldpc_campaign       % coded BLER/throughput (requires 5G Toolbox)
open NR_PDSCH_LinkLevel_Sim   % set SNR (dB) block, Stop Time 59, Run
sweep_snr_grid          % full Simulink sweep + verdicts vs MATLAB reference
```

## Reproducibility & provenance

Configuration is locked and logged (`matlab_results_massive_config.txt`), the seed is fixed, results are written to CSV before plotting, and every figure in the report regenerates from a stored file plus the source code. Two independent MATLAB runs and the Python implementation agree within Monte Carlo tolerances — the disagreement pattern itself (exact match on deterministic columns, spread only on random-error columns) is part of the verification evidence.

## Scope

Physical-layer link level only: no MAC scheduling, HARQ protocol timing, or higher-layer procedures; RF impairments (phase noise, IQ imbalance, PA nonlinearity) are deliberately outside the verified core and form the extension roadmap, starting from the measured PAPR.

## Technical Scope

This is a **PDSCH-oriented research and portfolio simulator**, not a commercial 3GPP conformance test platform.

The simulator models the main PHY signal-processing flow:

```text
Transport bits
→ CRC / coding interface
→ scrambling
→ QAM mapping
→ layer mapping
→ digital precoding
→ OFDM resource-grid generation
→ MIMO wireless channel + AWGN
→ DM-RS channel estimation
→ ZF/MMSE equalization
→ demodulation and metric computation
```

The project is intended for PHY algorithm understanding, link-level simulation practice, receiver-algorithm comparison, MIMO-OFDM performance evaluation, MATLAB/Python verification workflow, and GitHub engineering portfolio demonstration.

## MATLAB Simulation

MATLAB is used as the primary simulation and-verification platform.

```matlab
cd('02_MATLAB')
main
```

Expected outputs:

```text
04_Simulation_Results/MATLAB/csv/
04_Simulation_Results/MATLAB/figures/
```

The MATLAB implementation should generate BER, BLER or frame-error metric, EVM, NMSE, throughput, and MIMO capacity results.

---

## Python Reference Simulation

Python is used as an independent numerical reference implementation.

```bash
cd 03_Python
python main.py
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
```

Expected outputs:

```text
04_Simulation_Results/Python/csv/
04_Simulation_Results/Python/figures/
```

The Python implementation checks tensor organization, QAM normalization, channel/noise scaling, equalizer behavior, metric definitions, and MATLAB/Python numerical agreement.

---

## Simulink System-Level Model

The Simulink model provides a system-level architecture view and execution-flow wrapper around MATLAB algorithm functions.

```matlab
cd('05_Simulink')
build_project01_simulink_model
run_project01_simulink
```

Important boundary:

> Full native Simulink PHY blocks are not included. The Simulink model is a system-level architecture and wrapper around MATLAB-core numerical processing.

---

## Main Algorithms

### Effective MIMO channel model

```text
y[k] = G[k] s[k] + n[k]
```

where `G[k] = H[k]W[k]` is the effective channel after digital precoding.

### Channel estimation

The receiver estimates the effective channel using DM-RS symbols. LS estimation is performed per DM-RS resource element and per separated DM-RS port/layer.

### Equalization

The simulator supports:

- Zero-Forcing equalization
- MMSE equalization

### Metrics

The simulator computes BER, BLER-like frame-error ratio, EVM, NMSE, throughput, spectral efficiency, post-equalization SINR, and MIMO capacity.

---

## Verification Strategy

The verification approach follows four levels:

1. Unit verification of each processing module.
2. Analytical verification using AWGN BER and MIMO capacity references where available.
3. MATLAB/Python cross-check under the same configuration and random seed.
4. Regression verification using stored CSV outputs.
