## Project Status

> **Ongoing project- currently under development**

This project is being developed as a MATLAB- and Python-based simulation framework for studying **beam sweeping, beam measurement, and beam selection in directional wireless communication systems**.

The repository is currently a work in progress. The implementation, simulation results, figures, validation records, and documentation will be added and updated as development continues.

---

## Overview

Directional wireless systems use antenna arrays and beamforming to concentrate transmitted or received energy in selected spatial directions. Before communication can begin efficiently, the transmitter and receiver may need to search through a predefined set of candidate beams, measure the received signal quality for each beam pair, and select the most suitable beam.

This project will simulate that process through:

- transmit-beam sweeping;
- receive-beam sweeping;
- beam-pair measurement;
- beam-quality comparison;
- best-beam selection;
- performance evaluation under different channel and noise conditions;
- MATLAB and Python cross-checking.

The project is intended as an engineering simulation and verification study rather than a complete standards-conformance implementation.

---

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

1. model directional transmission using uniform linear arrays or uniform planar arrays;
2. generate configurable transmit and receive beam codebooks;
3. sweep candidate transmit and receive beam directions;
4. calculate the received signal level or beamforming gain for every beam pair;
5. select the beam pair that maximizes a defined quality metric;
6. evaluate beam-selection accuracy under noise, angular mismatch, multipath, and blockage;
7. compare exhaustive and reduced-complexity beam-search strategies;
8. verify the main numerical results independently in MATLAB and Python;
9. present the complete workflow with clear figures, tables, and technical documentation.

## Technical Scope

## Antenna-Array Modeling

For a uniform linear array (ULA) with $N$ antenna elements and inter-element spacing $d$, the normalized steering vector is

$$
\mathbf{a}(\theta)
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &
e^{j2\pi\frac{d}{\lambda}\sin(\theta)} &
\cdots &
e^{j2\pi(N-1)\frac{d}{\lambda}\sin(\theta)}
\end{bmatrix}^{T}.
$$

Here:

- $N$ is the number of antenna elements;
- $d$ is the spacing between adjacent antenna elements;
- $\lambda$ is the carrier wavelength;
- $\theta$ is the propagation or beam-steering angle measured from the array broadside;
- $j=\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit;
- $(\cdot)^T$ denotes the transpose operation.

The normalization factor $1/\sqrt{N}$ ensures that

$$
\left\|\mathbf{a}(\theta)\right\|_{2}^{2}
=
1.
$$

The sign of the phase progression may be reversed depending on the transmit, receive, and angle conventions used in the implementation. The MATLAB and Python implementations will use the same convention.

---

## Beam Codebook

The transmitter and receiver use finite beam codebooks defined as

$$
\mathcal{F}
=
\left\{
\mathbf{f}_{1},
\mathbf{f}_{2},
\ldots,
\mathbf{f}_{N_{\mathrm{TX}}}
\right\},
$$

and

$$
\mathcal{W}
=
\left\{
\mathbf{w}_{1},
\mathbf{w}_{2},
\ldots,
\mathbf{w}_{N_{\mathrm{RX}}}
\right\}.
$$

Here:

- $\mathbf{f}_{i}$ is the beamforming vector of the $i$-th transmit beam;
- $\mathbf{w}_{j}$ is the combining vector of the $j$-th receive beam;
- $N_{\mathrm{TX}}$ is the number of candidate transmit beams;
- $N_{\mathrm{RX}}$ is the number of candidate receive beams.

For steering-vector-based codebooks, the transmit beamforming vectors are defined as

$$
\mathbf{f}_{i}
=
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{TX}}(\theta_{i}),
\qquad
i=1,2,\ldots,N_{\mathrm{TX}},
$$

and the receive combining vectors are defined as

$$
\mathbf{w}_{j}
=
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{RX}}(\phi_{j}),
\qquad
j=1,2,\ldots,N_{\mathrm{RX}}.
$$

Here, $\theta_i$ and $\phi_j$ are the candidate transmit and receive beam directions, respectively.

The initial implementation will use uniformly spaced beam directions over a configurable angular search region. Additional codebook designs may be added later.

---

## Directional Channel Model

For transmit beam $i$ and receive beam $j$, the received reference signal is modeled as

$$
y_{i,j}
=
\mathbf{w}_{j}^{H}
\mathbf{H}
\mathbf{f}_{i}s
+
\mathbf{w}_{j}^{H}\mathbf{n}.
$$

Here:

- $y_{i,j}$ is the received signal for beam pair $(i,j)$;
- $\mathbf{H}$ is the MIMO channel matrix;
- $\mathbf{f}_{i}$ is the $i$-th transmit beamforming vector;
- $\mathbf{w}_{j}$ is the $j$-th receive combining vector;
- $s$ is the known transmitted reference symbol;
- $\mathbf{n}$ is the complex additive-noise vector;
- $(\cdot)^H$ denotes the Hermitian transpose.

The scalar effective channel associated with beam pair $(i,j)$ is

$$
h_{\mathrm{eff}}(i,j)
=
\mathbf{w}_{j}^{H}
\mathbf{H}
\mathbf{f}_{i}.
$$

The project will initially use a line-of-sight directional channel. Later versions may include multipath propagation, angular spread, path loss, shadowing, blockage, mobility, and beam misalignment.

---

## Beam Measurement

For every candidate transmit–receive beam pair, the receiver calculates a beam-quality metric. Possible metrics include:

- received reference-signal power;
- effective beamforming gain;
- signal-to-noise ratio;
- signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.

The ideal noise-free beam-pair gain is

$$
G_{i,j}
=
\left|
\mathbf{w}_{j}^{H}
\mathbf{H}
\mathbf{f}_{i}
\right|^{2}.
$$

When the transmitted reference symbol has unit energy, the noisy received-power measurement can be calculated as

$$
P_{i,j}
=
\left|y_{i,j}\right|^{2}.
$$

The metric $G_{i,j}$ represents the ideal channel and beamforming response. The metric $P_{i,j}$ includes the effect of measurement noise.

---

## Best-Beam Selection

Using the ideal beam-pair gain, the selected transmit and receive beam indices are

$$
\left(i^{\star},j^{\star}\right)
=
\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\substack{
1\leq i\leq N_{\mathrm{TX}} \\
1\leq j\leq N_{\mathrm{RX}}
}}
G_{i,j}.
$$

Using noisy beam measurements, the practical beam-selection rule is

$$
\left(\widehat{i},\widehat{j}\right)
=
\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\substack{
1\leq i\leq N_{\mathrm{TX}} \\
1\leq j\leq N_{\mathrm{RX}}
}}
P_{i,j}.
$$

Here:

- $(i^{\star},j^{\star})$ is the ideal best beam pair;
- $(\widehat{i},\widehat{j})$ is the beam pair selected from noisy measurements.

The simulation will compare the practically selected beam pair with the ideal beam pair and with the true channel departure and arrival directions. The comparison will be used to calculate:

- correct-beam-selection probability;
- angular selection error;
- beam quantization loss;
- received-power loss caused by an incorrect beam decision.

## Planned Simulation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ideal Single-Path Channel

- one dominant propagation path;
- no blockage;
- perfect array calibration;
- configurable additive noise;
- exhaustive beam search.

This scenario will verify the basic beam-sweeping and beam-selection logic.

### Scenario 2: Beam-Direction Mismatch

- the true departure or arrival angle falls between two codebook directions;
- beam quantization loss is evaluated;
- different codebook sizes are compared.

### Scenario 3: Low-SNR Beam Selection

- beam measurements are corrupted by noise;
- correct-beam-selection probability is evaluated versus SNR;
- repeated Monte Carlo trials are used.

### Scenario 4: Multipath Channel

- several paths have different gains and angles;
- the strongest measured beam may differ from the geometric line-of-sight direction;
- selection is evaluated using the combined channel response.

### Scenario 5: Blockage or Beam Failure

- the currently selected path is attenuated or removed;
- the system performs another beam sweep;
- recovery using an alternative beam is evaluated.

### Scenario 6: Reduced-Complexity Search

- exhaustive search is compared with hierarchical or two-stage search;
- search overhead and selection accuracy are evaluated jointly.

## Planned Figures

The completed project is expected to include:

- receive-array radiation pattern;
- beam-codebook angular coverage;
- beam-pair power heatmap;
- selected beam compared with the true direction;
- received power versus beam index;
- correct-selection probability versus SNR;
- angular error versus codebook size;
- beamforming gain versus angular mismatch;
- exhaustive-search overhead versus hierarchical-search overhead;

---

## MATLAB and Python Implementation

The MATLAB and Python implementations will follow the same antenna-array dimensions, angle convention, steering-vector definition, beam-codebook directions, channel coefficients, noise normalization, beam-quality metric, selection rule, Monte Carlo configuration, and result definitions.

Because MATLAB and Python may use different random-number generators, numerical verification will use deterministic channels, fixed beam codebooks, known test vectors, stage-by-stage comparisons, and tolerance-based checks of the final selected beam.

## Expected Engineering Outcome

The completed project is expected to demonstrate:

- how directional codebook beams cover an angular search region;
- how transmit and receive beam sweeping creates a beam-pair measurement matrix;
- how beam selection depends on SNR, array size, codebook resolution, and channel direction;
- why a larger codebook can reduce angular quantization loss but increase search overhead;
- how noise and multipath can cause incorrect beam selection;
- how hierarchical search can reduce overhead with a possible loss in selection accuracy;
- how MATLAB and Python can be used for independent model verification.

No final performance claim is made at the current development stage.
